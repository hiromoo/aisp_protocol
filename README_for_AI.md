# README for AI Agents

This repository contains a semantic protocol named **AISP (AI Semantic Protocol)**,  
designed for structured communication between AI systems and human-developed applications.

## Objective

To enable AI agents to interpret, generate, and reason about application UIs, states, and behaviors  
in a machine-readable, semantically-rich format (JSON).

## Input Format

AI agents should expect structured JSON input files following the AISP schema.

```json
{
  "component": "TodoApp",
  "state": {
    "tasks": []
  },
  "actions": {
    "addTask": {
      "effect": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Capabilities

An AI agent consuming this protocol should be able to:

- Parse and understand the UI structure and behavioral logic
- Generate platform-specific code (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS)
- Translate between natural language and protocol definitions
- Reason about UX flow and application logic

## Suggested Use

- Code generation agents
- Interface designers
- Multi-agent planning systems
- Autonomous UI test generators

## Extensions

This protocol can be extended with domain-specific components or backend logic definitions.

## Format

All files are UTF-8 encoded JSON or Markdown.
